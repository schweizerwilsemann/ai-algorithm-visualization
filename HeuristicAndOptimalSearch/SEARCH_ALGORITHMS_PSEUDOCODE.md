## Step Tracking Mechanism

The step tracking mechanism is a common pattern across all search algorithms. It records the state of the search at each step for visualization and educational purposes.

```
// Initialize step tracking
steps = [
    {
        step: 0,
        description: "Initialization: L = {startState}",
        u: null,
        neighbors: null,
        L: copy(L),
        // Additional algorithm-specific information
        g: {startState: 0},                    // For A* and Branch and Bound
        f: {startState: heuristicFn(startState)}, // For A* and Branch and Bound
        cost: cost                             // For Branch and Bound
    }
]

// Keep track of the step number
stepNumber = 1

// Add step for current node
steps.add({
    step: stepNumber,
    description: "u = {u}",
    u: u,
    neighbors: null,
    L: copy(L),
    // Additional algorithm-specific information
    g: copy(gScore),                       // For A* and Branch and Bound
    f: copy(fScore),                       // For A* and Branch and Bound
    cost: cost                             // For Branch and Bound
})
stepNumber++

// Add step for neighbors
steps.add({
    step: stepNumber,
    description: "Neighbors of {u}: {neighbors}. [Algorithm-specific description]",
    u: u,
    neighbors: neighbors,

## Step-by-Step Execution Example

Let's trace through a simple example to illustrate how the A* algorithm works with step tracking:

Consider a simple graph:
```
A -- 1 --> B -- 2 --> C
|          |
3          1
|          |
v          v
D -- 2 --> E -- 1 --> F
```

With heuristic values:
```
h(A) = 5
h(B) = 4
h(C) = 0 (goal)
h(D) = 3
h(E) = 2
h(F) = 1
```

Let's trace the A* algorithm with start state A and goal state C:

### Step 0: Initialization
```
L = [A]
g(A) = 0
f(A) = g(A) + h(A) = 0 + 5 = 5
```

### Step 1: Process node A
```
u = A
L = []
```

### Step 2: Process neighbors of A
```
Neighbors of A: B, D
Calculate:
  g(B) = g(A) + cost(A,B) = 0 + 1 = 1
  f(B) = g(B) + h(B) = 1 + 4 = 5
  g(D) = g(A) + cost(A,D) = 0 + 3 = 3
  f(D) = g(D) + h(D) = 3 + 3 = 6
Sort L by f values:
L = [B, D]
```

### Step 3: Process node B
```
u = B
L = [D]
```

### Step 4: Process neighbors of B
```
Neighbors of B: C, E
Calculate:
  g(C) = g(B) + cost(B,C) = 1 + 2 = 3
  f(C) = g(C) + h(C) = 3 + 0 = 3
  g(E) = g(B) + cost(B,E) = 1 + 1 = 2
  f(E) = g(E) + h(E) = 2 + 2 = 4
Sort L by f values:
L = [C, E, D]
```

### Step 5: Process node C
```
u = C
C is the goal state. Search succeeds.
Path: A -> B -> C
```

The step tracking mechanism records each of these steps, allowing the user to see exactly how the algorithm explores the search space and finds the optimal path.
